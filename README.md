# Mask-detection
Introduction
This project aims to detect whether individuals are wearing masks using computer vision techniques. In the context of public health and safety, detecting mask-wearing behavior can aid in enforcing policies aimed at reducing the spread of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. I have taken two classes which are mask and no mask.
